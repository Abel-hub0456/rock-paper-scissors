# rock-paper-scissors
Python code for a 2-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
It's a 2-player game. Player(user) VS CPU.
This game requests for user input and checks if the input is valid, if user input is invalid it throws an error message and requests user to input a valid option.
CPU choice is made from a list of Rock, Paper, Scissors using the choice method from the inbuilt Python module random.
When both choices are made, it checks for winner and prints it out.
If the two players choose the same “character”, it prints "It’s a tie" and the game repeats.
